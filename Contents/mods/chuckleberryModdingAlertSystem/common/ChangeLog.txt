[ 1/18/25 - Remaster for B42 ]
Remastered the UI to be more streamlined based on feedback:
- No longer separate mod-alert and drop message.
- The first alert will remain a message about supporting modding, the rest will be customizable alerts per mod.
- The alert symbol will be marked red when new alerts are found, to be cleared as they are read-through.
- Subsequent reloads will mark all alerts as old.
- Added more UI to allow for scrolling forward/back along the alerts list.

The system has been remastered into a true API - so that any mod-author can make use of it:
- As before only requires mod-author to include a ChangeLog.txt (Now expected in /common/ for B42+, as before /media/ for B41-)
- Alerts support programmable buttons by the mod's respective author.
- Well known sites are color-coded and override a provided title with a logo.
- Sites that do not start with: `https://steamcommunity.com`, `https://projectzomboid.com`, `https://theindiestone.com`, require Steam's link filter: `https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=`.
See: ChangeLog.txt entry: ALERT_CONFIG for an example.
