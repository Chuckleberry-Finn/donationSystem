I will continue to maintain, support, troubleshoot, and update my mods as I always have. However, these other priorities must come first. If you’ve enjoyed my work and would like to support it, donations are greatly appreciated. Donations make it more feasible for me to dedicate time and effort to these projects. That said, there’s absolutely no pressure; please only donate if you’re comfortable and able. Your enjoyment of my mods is already a tremendous reward. Thank you for your support and understanding!",
