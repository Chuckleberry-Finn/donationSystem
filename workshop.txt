description=If you're interested in utilizing this system to display change-logs all you have to do is create a text file named 'ChangeLog.txt' within your mod's media folder.
description=This mod includes a working example, but the format would be:
description=[quote][ header ]<br>line<br>line<br>[ ------ ][/quote]
description=Note the footer and header must be within spaced square brackets, and the footer must have six hyphens.
