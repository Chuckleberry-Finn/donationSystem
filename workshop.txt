description=If you're interested in utilizing this system to display change-logs all you have to do is create a text file named 'ChangeLog.txt' within your mod's common folder. This mod includes a working example. Note the footer and header must be within spaced square brackets, and the footer must have six hyphens. Also, uploading your mod to the workshop will automatically populate the Steam changelog with the last entry - if the mod is enabled on the main menu.
